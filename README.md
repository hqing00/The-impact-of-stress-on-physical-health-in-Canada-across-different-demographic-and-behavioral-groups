This project was developed as part of a coursework assignment in Statistics for Data Science (WQD7013)

## Problem Statement
- Chronic stress becomes a public health concern due to its contribution to the likelihood of developing physical illnesses.
- There is limited insight into the common characteristics and physical health issues among individuals in Canada.
- It is important to identify the potential demographic and behavioral factors that contribute to high stress levels and a higher risk of developing physical health issues.

## Objective
1. To identify the most common physical health issues and demographic compositions of individuals experiencing high stress in Canada.
2. To determine if there are significant differences in stress levels across various demographic groups, particularly those with higher reported stress percentages.
3. To analyze the correlation between stress levels and the number of physical health issues among working individuals based on their demographics and behaviors.
